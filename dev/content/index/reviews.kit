            <p>I awaited the delivery of my Smeg toaster like a dog waiting for his master to return home after a long day. I almost found myself barking as the USPS truck rolled up my street. Thankfully I refrained from running towards the mailman with my tongue hanging out of my mouth, but it was difficult. Oh if only he knew the beauty that lay within that box! I'd had my eyes on this extortionately priced bread warmer for years and I'd finally achieved the perfect balance of stupidity and wealth to pay $250 for a...</p>

            <p>We bought the Smeg larger 4-slice toaster which fits those monster size pieces of sourdough bread quite lovely. Now, for such a simplified appliance my opinion is that it's way too expensive for what it is- although its weight feels pretty heavy duty. I was very concerned about the bad reviews but I love the color red and was drawn to this toaster. Upon arrival, we actually READ THE INSTRUCTIONS and found the appliance to work seamlessly and as expected. There are very specific instructions about the settings an...</p>

            <p>This thing is AH-MAZING! Finally, a toaster that only toasts one side of the bread and leaves the other side as soft as a Democrat on the Southern border!<br><br>Remember the days of golden-brown toast popping playfully from the toaster? Oh, so warm and inviting! Well, now those days are gone! This SMEG death-box—designed in Italy by overpriced suits but manufactured and weaponized in a Chinese sweatshop—...</p>
